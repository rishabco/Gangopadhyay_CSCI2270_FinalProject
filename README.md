CSCI 2270 Final Project 

Project Summary 

Our project will serve as a trip planner for a series of railroads. We will use a HashTable which stores linked lists of Train Station classes. A train will be able to travel up and down the linked lists to visit the train stations. We will likely also incorporate a single train that would traverse up and down the array of the hashtable. As a result if a user wants to go have a starting and destination points in differnt indexes, a user will be prompted to take a train from the starting station to the "main" train (that transverses the array), then another train that goes down the linked list to the specific station. 

How to Run

The user will interact with a Main Menu that will have a variety of functions, including:

Add Station
Delete Station
Find Station
Find Path Between Stations
Print Stations


Dependencies

Standard C++ librarries
