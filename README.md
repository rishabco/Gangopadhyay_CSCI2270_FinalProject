CSCI 2270 Final Project 

Project Summary 

Our project is a Trip Route Planner. 

Our project will serve as a trip planner for a series of railroads. We will use a HashTable which stores linked lists of Train Station classes. A train will be able to travel up and down the linked lists to visit the train stations. We will likely also incorporate a single train that would traverse up and down the array of the hashtable. As a result if a user wants to go have a starting and destination points in differnt indexes, a user will be prompted to take a train from the starting station to the "main" train (that transverses the array), then another train that goes down the linked list to the specific station. 

How to Run

When the User starts the program, the program a graph is generated from a .txt file. (We will include a file "cities.txt" as an example)

-Add Station.
-Delete Station.
-Find Station.
-Find Path Between Stations.
-Print Stations.
-Calculate Distance of Travel.
