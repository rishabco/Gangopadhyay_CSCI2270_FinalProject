CSCI 2270 Final Project 

Project Summary 

Our project is a Trip Route Planner. 

Our project will serve as a trip planner for cities in the United States. The program will allow you to input a starting and ending city city and provide information on how to get there. The unique aspect of our program is that there are different districts located across the country. This means, for example, if your starting city and destination are in different cities, the program will inform you how to travel to your nearest "hub city" (where there is an airport), to take a flight from that airport to the next airport, and then directions on how to get from the airport to your destination city. 

How to Run

When the User starts the program, the program a graph is generated from a .txt file. (We will include a file "cities.txt" as an example)

A menu is then displayed with the following options:

1. Print All City Options
2. View Options for Ground Travel
3. View Options for Air Travel
4. Begin Planning Trip
5. Quit
