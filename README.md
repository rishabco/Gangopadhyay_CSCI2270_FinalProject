CSCI 2270 Final Project 

Project Summary 

Our project idea is a Vacation+Trip Planner. It will utilize a graph similar to the one used in Assignment 8. The program will generate a map around which the user can plan a trip. There will be differenct graph weights corresponding to distances, time, or cost. 

How to Run

The user begins by starting the program and selecting countries that they would like to travel around. Once a map is selected, the program asks a series of questions about the user's travel plans. Examples include things like: 

Starting point
Ending point
Other places they may want to travel in between
Mode of transportation
User's budget
Types of activities they want to do while on their trip 
Based on the user's answers the program's job is to suggest options for travel routes, give estimated costs, and compare different modes of transportation, and give suggestions on what they can do in each city. 

Dependencies
